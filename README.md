# Aggregate the scientific community

Filter these in the subsections below:

- Kind of council of elders of top crunchers: identify and engage top scientific profile from the community 
- Allow elders to interact with the research paper in a DeSci way 
- Orchestrate the call for signal and Cherry peek the best signals 

- Work on the definition of KPIs. Some ideas: 
    - Number of interaction on the paper
    - Median signal performance (Sharpe, ROI, DD)
    - Number of interaction with the podcasts.
    - Some way to evaluate the engagement of the syndacate.

## DeSci framework for decentralized paper writing

In the process of setting this up, document design choices and use them to populate a first paper talking about 
its underlying technology.

- Integrate LaTeX/Markedown + Python.
- Generate papers with github actions.
- Render paper in CrunchDAO website and build UX for easy reviews/comments/pull requests.

- Integrate ResearchRabbit or something like it;
- Integrate SciHub, libgen and others in the backend.
- Integrate knowledge graphs, once out, from [Lateral](https://www.lateral.io/)

## The research paper(s) V1.0: Cover the CrunchDAO investment rationale

- Start from website+documentation, 2 medium articles, CrunchDAO website. 
- Study NumerAI and RocketCapital and understand differences.
- Record long technical deep talk with Jean to understand everything.

- Layer 1 vs Layer 2 in CrunchDAO

- Understand and document Udit work;
- Digest and document "Crowdsourced Investment Research Through Tournaments" and Lopez de Prado more in general;
- How can people add different datasets? 

## NFTs

At the beginning, we gift an NFT to people we want as advisors and having one leads to being able to give a feedback on the paper. See [here](https://www.boffinsociety.xyz/) and [here](https://desci.world/). This will allow people to join the GROUP OF COOL PEOPLE YET TO BE NAMED (Mathematical syndicate?).

The NFTs could be about stochastic processes (video+audio), and about financial models more in general.

Then we vote with tokens to decide whether the pull request on the paper is accepted or not. Voting on the papers shall become part of civil duties. How will be individual decisions be integrated into the final one? More token more power, one head one vote? Or something fancy like ["A Flexible Design for Funding Public Goods"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421). Or something like [this](https://www.bretthennig.com/reinvigorating_democracy_through_random_selection)?

What is the role of SBTs here? Decentralized Society: Finding Web3â€™s Soul.

The outcome of the peer review changes your grade in the DAO which changes your access to the APY, Alternative idea, you stake on the pull request and if it is bad you lose.

For all this, we need IPFS + git. See [here](https://radicle.xyz/), maybe.

## Social Presence (Talk with Ben for this)

- Stardust Podcast (or alternative one?) The crunch podcast ? 2 / month? Maybe call it Matteo podcast and talk about CrunchDAO. Talk about the models, talk about the results. 
- LinkedIn
- Twitter
- Medium, or maybe [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) better?
- Youtube
- Anchor

# R&D finance

- The research paper(s) V1.0: Cover the CrunchDAO investment rationale 
- Iterate once every 4 weeks on a new update of the paper 
- KPIs
    - MM Sharpe
    - Backtest
        - MM ROI - backtest
        - MM DD - backtest
        - Competition OWEN and Spearman
