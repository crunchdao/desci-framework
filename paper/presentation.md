# CrunchDAO

[CrunchDAO](https://www.crunchdao.com/) is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization of scientists making use of collective intelligence to solve complex problems, powered by a solid tokeconomics:

# The role of the DAO

Crowdsourced Investment is changing the financial industry [[@Prado2019CrowdsourcedIR]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3454234): in CrunchDAO, we want to do more!

Our DeSci infrastructure will enable all of us to contribute as researchers, and not only as data scientists, to the DAO.

# The role of the DAO

**"For it is unworthy of distinguished men to waste their time with slavish calculations."**

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1672

# Decentralized Science

"[Decentralized Science (DeSci)](https://desci.com/roadmap): creating infrastructure and advocating for distributed coordination to support scientific progress, creating systems for scientists to recapture the value they create." [[@Buterin_2019]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06421)

- Infrastructure to tackle the [tragedy of the anticommons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_anticommons) (i.e., to incentivise avoiding reinventing the wheel);
- Update of the traditional unit of knowledge: beyond PDFs;
- Tackling the reproducibility crisis: incentive system for replication and validation;
- Overcoming the limitations of traditional peer-revie, using web3 technologies [@Tenorio2018].

# DeSci in CrunchDAO

CrunchDAO is interested in crowdsourcing research, not only alpha.

- The tokeconomics will be expanded to include scientific contributions.

- We are proposing a research framework in order to foster quality, speed, and transparency.

- This framework will be a tool for the DAO in all the fields of science.
